                This study started out with an aim to build a deep learning model to classify for Alzheimer’s disease.
                The research evaluated various past studies to understand the gap in this field. Most past research
                focus on building an image classification model on MRI scans to classify for Alzheimer’s. However, in
                practice doctors use a lot of other information before coming to a diagnosis. Therefore, the study
                then aimed to build a multi-input deep learning graph model to classify for Alzheimer’s while trying
                to replicate the real-world diagnosis.

                research and against single input models. The best graph model built has a test accuracy of 95.51% and
                replicates the real-world diagnosis process more than most studies currently available.</p>

              <p class="section-text">Today, digital content is vastly used in all field. One of the main elements of
                most digital content is text. Various studies in the past have looked at how different styling
                elements of a test affect recall memory. However, the findings from these studies have been
                inconsistent. Furthermore, very few areas have focused on how digital text affects memory. This study
                aims to study the effect of digital font size on free recall in adults. The study has thirty-six
                participants sampled using opportunity sampling and follows a between-group designs. A gorilla
                experiment was built with a free recall task and each participant was assigned a font group at the
                beginning of the experiment. The three-font size used are ‘18pt’, ‘48pt’, and ‘78pt’. The study used
                one-way ANOVA to analyse the data and fount no statistically significant difference in means between
                the three group. This study adds to the past literature significantly as there are very few past
                studies looking at the impact of digital font size on free recall. Moreover, this results from this
                study contradict previous studies which have not looked at digital font sizes. Therefore, suggesting
                that there is a difference in how humans perceive fonts on paper on digitally.</p>

                has led to a surge in the number of gamers in the past decade. Past research have shown how
                parent-child relationships can affect the impact of gaming on adolescents. Therefore, this study aims
                to understand the impact of gaming on adolescents from a parent’s point of view. Two parents were
                interviewed using semi-structured interviews. The data collected from these interviews were then
                analysed using thematic analysis. Three superordinate themes were identified: “Factors influencing
                parent’s decision to allow their children to game”, “Experiences of the impact of gaming”, and
                “Parental measures to minimise the impact of gaming”. The research further highlights the importance
